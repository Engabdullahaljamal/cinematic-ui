# Immersive Cinematic UI – Front-End Trial Task

## Live Demo
https://engabdullahaljamal.github.io/cinematic-ui/

## Source Code
This repository contains the full source code for the project.

## Creative Approach
The original experience relies on a complex 3D scene.
I replaced the 3D with a cinematic looping video combined with layered overlays,
parallax motion, and scroll-driven transitions to preserve immersion and depth.

## Technologies Used
- React
- Vite
- GSAP + ScrollTrigger
- Lenis (smooth scrolling)
- CSS for visual effects and overlays

## Key Focus Areas
- Scroll-synchronized animations
- Cinematic pacing
- Performance-conscious transforms
- Clean component architecture

## Video Walkthrough

## AI Tool Usage
I used ChatGPT for:
- brainstorming animation approaches
- debugging scroll-related issues
- refining component structure

All implementation and final decisions are my own.

## Reflection
Given more time, I would:
- further optimize scroll performance on low-end devices
- add reduced-motion accessibility support
- refine mobile-specific interactions
